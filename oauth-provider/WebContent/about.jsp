<p class="lead" align="justify">OAuth is an open standard for
	authorization. OAuth provides client applications a 'secure delegated
	access' to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies
	a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their
	server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed
	specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth
	essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by
	an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner, or
	end-user. The client then uses the access token to access the protected
	resources hosted by the resource server. OAuth is commonly used as a
	way for Internet users to log into third party websites using their
	Microsoft, Google, Facebook or Twitter accounts without exposing their
	password.</p>
